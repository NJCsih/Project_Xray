# Project_Xray
*I'm aware the name is terrible*

## Overview:
This project is an attempt to brign back what rss was, a way that manually curated channels can be created, and items will always be shown.
More or less this is just a spitefull attempt to circumvent youtube's algorithm and subscription system that doesnt always show me everything I want to see.
